# Snake game

Snake is a computer game. 
The player controls a long, thin snake-like creature that crawls along a plane (usually bounded by walls), collecting food (or other items) while avoiding collision with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Every time a snake eats a piece of food, it gets longer.
